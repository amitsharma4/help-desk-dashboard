Intuitive and Easy to Learn - Call Tracking software never got easier.
   <br>
   <br>
Many systems need a steep learning curve but HelpDesk customer service trouble ticket system is intuitive and the well designed screen layouts make the system easy for operators to both learn to use, and to interface with on a day to day basis - little, if any, training is required.<br>
An on screen 'help' system can be called up at any time.<br><br>

Client Call Reports(Trouble Tickets)are automatically stamped with the â€˜Clientâ€™s name, ID, date, & time of call.<br>
Calls must be given a â€˜Priorityâ€™ rating by the client logging the call - this rating can be upgraded or downgraded at any time.<br>
Operators can see the status of their Unresolved Call queue at all times.<br>
Help Desk Includes a Database for Client & Operator Details.<br><br>

Clientâ€™s â€˜Name, Company, Address, E-mail & Phone numbersâ€™ can be automatically called up from an associated database(included) and these details will be incorporated in the Call Report on-screen views.<br>
If the client has a history of calls, then this history, and the details of the calls are instantly available for the operator to view - without leaving the main Call screen.<br>
Operator's details are also on file and easily available.<br>
Users Can Easily Manage the Calls They 'Pick-up'<br><br>

The operator can temporarily leave a Trouble Ticket â€˜Unresolvedâ€™ and take another call, and any of these â€˜Unresolvedâ€™ calls are listed in that Operator's Unresolved queue for immediate â€˜recallâ€™ at any time.<br>
The operator must change a call status to â€˜Resolvedâ€™ in order for the system to consider it satisfactorily handled.<br>
An operator can â€˜Referâ€™ a call to another operator or supervisor if they feel unable to handle it themselves after first picking up the call.<br>
Call Queue Status Always Visible<br>

The status of Call Queues is displayed on the left hand side of all main operational screen pages and this enables the status of all unactioned calls, unresolved calls, referred calls, etc. to be seen at a glance.<br>
An Operator can instantly get further details and a listing from the particular queue.<br>
Extensive Reports Quickly Available<br><br>

'Client' focus reports, 'Operator' focus reports.<br>
A clientâ€™s call records, either a single call or complete history can be presented as an on-screen report or printed out. Similarly, call reports related to a particular operator can be quickly called up.<br>
A log is kept of elapsed time taken to resolve each call. If a resolved call is reopened then the log is opened again and the operatorâ€™s name who opened and closed is recorded. These logged details form part of the individual Call report<br>
100% Web-based, - No other Software Components to Install or Maintain<br>
<br>
Your Clients of the help desk only need their web browser to log in a new support call, or check on the status of an existing call.<br>
Similarly, Operators and Supervisors of the HelpDesk also only need their web browser to interface fully with the system - and they can do this from anywhere, - home, office, across the State, across the World! This facilitates enormous flexibility for managers of the HelpDesk operation who have the responsibility of ensuring there are enough resources available.<br>
Be aware! With many web-based, server-based software application, there are EXPENSIVE and often hidden requirements for you to purchase additional software components in order to have a functioning system e.g. database software components, web-servers, middle-ware. This is NOT the case with HelpDesk Pro. If you are evaluating any other system, make sure you fully investigate this important aspect of the 'full cost of ownership'. Full benefits of web applications - go >> here.<br>
'Whiteboard' Alert , Auto-messaging Facility<br>
<br>
A system-wideâ€œWhiteboardâ€ is available to flag and alert operators to messages - operators are alerted to important changes on the whiteboard automatically, and must view the whiteboard to clear the alert.<br>
Whiteboard messages can be given a priority as to their importance to users.<br>
Equipment/Asset Managenent/Software Database for Inventory Management - includes Barcodes<br>

To facilitate Asset Management, an equipment database is integrated and client calls can be 'linked' to a particular product or item of equipment. This can easily build to be a comprehensive inventory management tool.<br>
An in-built barcode generation tool allows individual barcodes to be printed out for each asset item if this is required. This barcode generation feature does NOT require any special barcode fonts to be installed on any computer.[Please note, that if you choose to host your copy of HelpDesk Pro, rather than have us host it, then the application needs to be able to access an external web site(ours) in order to generate the barcodes] <br>
Go >> here to see how the built-in Asset Management is a breeze!.<br>
FAQ Knowledge Base Facility<br>
<br>
The FAQ Knowledge Base will quickly become a key element in facilitating quick resolution of problems and a valuable experience repository.<br>
The Knowledge Base has been designed with an in-built auto-prompt for Operators which makes it easy for them to add call resolution incidents to the knowledge base.<br>
Auto E-mailing & SMS Messaging to Operators<br>
<br>
A special Call Response facility is provided so that particular Operators and/or Supervisors can be sent automatic e-mail alerts as particular Calls come in e.g. these might be Categories of Calls with a 'Critical' Priority.<br>
An option is to use the in-built gateway which facilitates sending out an SMS message to their cell phone(200 free SMS call credits are included!).<br>
Would you like to test our SMS gateway and send a message to your phone now? Go >> here.<br>
Auto E-mailing of New Trouble Ticket Acknowledgement, and Resolution Progress to Clients<br>
<br>
Clients are automatically sent an e-mail when they log a new Call into the HelpDesk - and at the handling Operator's discretion they can also be sent e-mails automatically advising of Resolution of the Call, or progress in handling it.<br>
Password Logon Provides System Security<br>
<br>
Both Operators and Clients of the HelpDesk logon the system by password control.<br>
Levels of 'system privilege' allow for supervisors to have more control, and facilitate differing privilege levels for Operators.<br>
Customization of HelpDesk Pro is Possible<br>
<br>
Within HelpDesk, users can customize many of the data entry areas to suit the particular business. For example, the Call Priorities, Call Categories, and Asset Category fields can be tailored to suit your type of business.<br>
Almost no limit to further customization that can be done to tailor the system to your operation (charges apply for individual special customization).<br>
Requires Only the Web Browser on Clients and Operators Computers<br>
<br>
For both your Operators and your clients, HelpDesk Pro is hardware independent - so long as the client or Operator has a (modern) web browser on their computer, they have access to the helpdesk.<br>
Your computers, and your client's computers, can be PCs, Macs, with ANY operating system installed.<br>
Call Resolution Time can be Billed - Make your HelpDesk Pay!<br>
<br>
You can opt to 'cost' each Call, and to vary the hourly billing rates, and so with this facility you are able to bill clients if you wish.<br>
The minutes/hours of the Call Resolution process are automatically calculated.<br>
<br>
